/**
 * Visits all key-value pairs or array items in depth-first order,
 * expands any reference values, mutates the original object and returns
 * it. Cyclic references are not allowed and will throw an error.
 * However, refs pointing to other refs are recursively resolved (again,
 * provided there are no cycles).
 *
 * Reference values are special strings representing lookup paths of
 * other values in the object and are prefixed with `@` for relative
 * refs or `@/` for absolute refs and both using `/` as path separator
 * (Note: trailing slashes are NOT allowed!). Relative refs are resolved
 * from the currently visited object and support "../" prefixes to
 * access any parent levels. Absolute refs are always resolved from the
 * root level (the original object passed to this function).
 *
 * ```ts
 * // `c` references sibling `d`
 * // `d` references parent `a`
 * resolve({a: 1, b: {c: "@d", d: "@/a"} })
 * // { a: 1, b: { c: 1, d: 1 } }
 * ```
 *
 * Any function values are called using two possible conventions:
 *
 * 1) If the user function uses ES6 object destructuring for its first
 *    argument, the given object keys are resolved prior to calling the
 *    function and the resolved values provided as first argument
 *    (object) and a general `resolve` function as second argument.
 * 2) If no de-structure form is found in the function's arguments, the
 *    function is only called with `resolve` as argument.
 *
 * **Important:** Since ES6 var names can't contain special characters,
 * destructured keys can ALWAYS only be looked up as siblings of the
 * currently processed key.
 *
 * The `resolve` function provided as arg to the user function accepts a
 * path (**without `@` prefix**) to look up any other values in the root
 * object.
 *
 * ```
 * // `c` uses ES6 destructuring form to look up `a` & `b` values
 * // `d` uses provided resolve fn arg `$` to look up `c`
 * resolve({a: 1, b: 2, c: ({a,b}) => a + b, d: ($) => $("c") })
 * // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 3 }
 *
 * // last item references item @ index = 2
 * resolve([1,2, ($) => $("0") + $("1"), "@2"])
 * // [1, 2, 3, 3]
 * ```
 *
 * The return value of the user provided function is used as final value
 * for that key in the object. This mechanism can be used to compute
 * derived values of other values stored anywhere in the root object.
 * **Function values will always be called only once.** Therefore, in
 * order to associate a function as final value to a key, it MUST be
 * wrapped with an additional function, as shown for the `e` key in the
 * example below. Similarly, if an actual string value should happen to
 * start with `@`, it needs to be wrapped in a function (see `f` key
 * below).
 *
 * ```
 * // `a` is derived from 1st array element in `b.d`
 * // `b.c` is looked up from `b.d[0]`
 * // `b.d[1]` is derived from calling `e(2)`
 * // `e` is a wrapped function
 * res = resolve({
 *   a: ($) => $("b/c") * 100,
 *   b: { c: "@d/0", d: [2, ($) => $("../../e")(2) ] },
 *   e: () => (x) => x * 10,
 *   f: () => "@foo",
 * })
 * // { a: 200, b: { c: 2, d: [ 2, 20 ] }, e: [Function], f: "@foo" }
 *
 * res.e(2);
 * // 20
 * ```
